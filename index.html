  <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="blank" title="html5 specification">Machine Learning (ML)</a> is the study of computer algorithms that <strong><u>improve automatically</u> through experience</strong> and by the use of data.

  </p><p style="margin-top:45px">It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.</p>
