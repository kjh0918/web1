  <h2>CNN</h2>
  <p>In deep learning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" target="blank" title="CNN specification">a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet)</a> is a class of deep neural network, most commonly applied to <strong>analyze visual <u>imagery</u></strong>.

  </p><p style="margin-top:45px">They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation equivariant responses known as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are only equivariant, as opposed to invariant, to translation. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series.</p>
