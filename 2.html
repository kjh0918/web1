  <h2>RNN</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network" target="blank" title="RNN specification">A recurrent neural network (RNN)</a> is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along <strong><u>a temporal sequence</u></strong>.

  </p><p style="margin-top:45px">This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition.</p>
